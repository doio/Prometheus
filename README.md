# FAQ

Q: Why does Prometheus crash after I close the alert?

A: Reason not known yet, if this happens to you, compile using Xcode and send me the whole log after the app crashes. UPDATE: it might work if you compile it yourself with Xcode, preferably version 8 or 9 Beta.  If it doesn't send me the log from the bottom of Xcode. *install.sh still must be ran, as per instructions*.


Q: Why I can't choose a custom ipsw?

A: Still working on that, the scripts are risky and not fully functional, anyway, iOS 10.3.3 is the only signed firmware so you don't need that option. 



Q: 32bit devices? / Odysseus?

A: No



Q: How do I update to the latest futurerestore?

A: Run install.sh again



Q: Is the current build risky?

A: No, same as futurerestore



Q: How do I update the Prometheus app?

A: Redownload it from here
